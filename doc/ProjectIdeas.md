# Project Ideas

This guide serves as a curated list of possible new features or potential enhancements that can be included into PowerPointLabs. These ideas are by no means fixed as further discussions would be required with the project mentor on feasibility, scalability, etc, before the approval is given to develop the ideas.

**Note**: Feel free to add to this list, but keep the documentation consistent and readable.

### Widgets Lab
This lab can represent a collection of commonly used PowerPoint widgets such as:
1. [Polls](https://www.participoll.com/)
1. [Timer](http://youpresent.co.uk/free-stuff/free-powerpoint-stopwatch/)
1. [Wheel of fortune](http://www.giftedguru.com/wheel-of-choice-free-download/)
1. Progress Bar

### Syntax Lab
This lab can be used to scan text within each slide and automatically highlight code snippets in slides.

### Charts Lab
This lab provides a collection of charts for the user such as:
1. Gantt Chart
1. Box Plot
1. Pareto Chart

### Text Lab
This lab allows users to easily set the language of the future/existing text in the presentation, for either a few slides or for the whole presentation. Users can also use this lab to set text fonts/color, enabling the standardising of fonts for selected slides or for the entire presentation.

### Layer Lab
This lab splits each selected slide into layers in which items can be assigned. Within a layer it should be possible to hide or isolate items belonging to a certain layer for greater control. Users should be able to move the layers to the front or back, much like the layers seen in Photoshop.
