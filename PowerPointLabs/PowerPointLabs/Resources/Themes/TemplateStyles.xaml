        The TemplateStyles Resource Dictionary contains the Styles of different 
        controls, such as Button or Label, but without the properties related to
        color, such as Background or Foreground. Instead, they are obtained as
        DynamicResources from other ResourceDictionaries, linked together by the
        respective Theme.xaml files.
